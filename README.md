Computational Astrphysics project scripts

Bussatori scripts:
Here there are the Computational Astrophysics project scripts. The ones called 'Old_version' refer to a previous analysis I performed but then we realized there was an error in the sorting so I wrote other scripts to fix it and proceed with the rest of the study. The script for the output selection has been written in common with Cecilia Giorgi

Kulubayeva scripts:
Here there are three examples of the scripts performed on the output files but there are other just like these ones for all the other simulations.
