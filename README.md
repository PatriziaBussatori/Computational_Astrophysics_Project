Computational Astrphysics project scripts

Bussatori scripts:
Here there are the Computational Astrophysics project scripts. The ones called 'Old_version' refer to a previous analyses I performed but then we realized there was an error in the sorting
so I wrote other scripts to fix it and proceed with the rest of the study. Hope everything is clear.
