Computational Astrphysics project scripts

Bussatori scripts:
Here there are the Computational Astrophysics project scripts. The ones called 'Old_version' refer to a previous analysis I performed but then we realized there was an error in the sorting so I wrote other scripts to fix it and proceed with the rest of the study. 

Giorgi scripts:
Meanvalues_&_MassRatiohist.ipynb : jupyter notebook to calculate mean values and plot the histogram of mass ratio for all simulations
NEWsubplots.ipynb: jupyter notebook to fix three final subloplots for interactive systems

DataSelection.py : script to retrieve data from demoblack server (Bussatori and Giorgi)
